# Printing Instructions


### This **MUST** be printed in 95a TPU! No other material is known to work!

Select the center section and change the per model settings to the ones below.<p>The thicker your infill line width + the denser your mesh and the stiffer the band will be. I dont recommend going any thinner than .4mm at 25%</br>

Print the Side clips in a stiff material such as PLA, ABS, or PETG.

After all if that is printed, head to [the installation instructions](https://github.com/CapraAudio/CapraStrapra-Focal/blob/main/Printing-Instructions.md) to assemble it!
