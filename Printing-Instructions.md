# Printing Instructions

This **MUST** be printed in 95a TPU! No other material is known to work!

Select the center section and change the per model settings to the ones below.  
The thicker your infill line width + the denser your mesh and the stiffer the band will be. I dont recommend going any thinner than .4mm at 25%

Print the Side clips in a stiff material such as PLA, ABS, or PETG.
